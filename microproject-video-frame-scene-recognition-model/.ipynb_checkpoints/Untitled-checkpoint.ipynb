    "Visual images are an important part of all media and Data Scientists are often using images as data sources.  In this MicroProject, you will create a simple model to detect the amount of time spent in two different \"scenes\" we used when creating office-hour style videos for Data Science DISCOVERY.  To do this, you will learn how to import an entire folder of images, preform image analysis, and create your own model without using a pre-build library.  Let's nerd out! :)\n",

To learn the background and hear from Karle and Wade about the journey of creating DISCOVERY, go over and listen to our episode on the \"Teach Talk Listen Learn Podcast\" where talk with TTLL host Bob Dignan and our CITL video producer Eric Schumacher: https://citl.illinois.edu/citl-101/teaching-learning/teach-talk-listen-learn*"
